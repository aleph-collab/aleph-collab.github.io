## English

#### Passage 1

>  A nation’s literature is the mirror through which  
> people see themselves. Children and adults need to see  
> themselves in their country’s fiction and poetry. Lois-  
> (line 5) Ann Yamanaka, the Pushcart Prize-winning poet and  
> author of the book Name Me Nobody, said: “. . . until  
> you see yourself in literature, in the written word, you  
> don’t exist.” This is why every national school  
> curriculum includes the study of its nation’s literary  
> (line 10) works.  
>   Reading the literature of a country is like listening  
> to its heartbeat. One hears the hopes, fears and angst of  
> ordinary folks like you and me. At the universal level,  
> literature is the bridge built by Imagination to help us  
> (line 15) cross over into the interior landscape of those who are  
> different from us, and yet the same, and as  
> extraordinary and odd as ourselves.  
>   The writer’s focus provides readers with insights  
> into their society. To express the unexpressed, to say  
> (line 20) the unsaid, to give voice to those with no voice— this  
> has always been one of literature’s many contributions.  
> In literature, king or beggar, prime minister or dialect-  
> speaking squatter, all are equal; all can take centre  
> stage as the main character. No other school subject  
> (line 25) focuses on the individual or marginalised in the way  
> literature does. This, in itself, is a moral force in a  
> world in which numbers count, and wealth, power and  
> intellect dominate  
>   Singapore literature has something to offer us, and  
> (line 30) the world. It is neither monocultural nor monolingual.  
> Comprising the poetry and fiction of four official  
> languages, Singapore literature writes across language  
> and culture. The congregation of English and Asian  
> voices is part of our national fabric and identity as a  
> (line 35) people.  
>   The Singapore novelist writing in English accepts  
> the challenge of recreating and rendering the variety of  
> Asian voices and languages into English. Our literary  
> fiction, poetry and plays offer the reader multiple  
> perspectives and individual narratives that question,  
> (line 40) challenge and broaden our views of ourselves beyond  
> the national Singapore Story and the officially  
> sanctioned founding myth. In the long run, while  
> geography and politics continue to shape our nation,  
> our literature will reveal our collective soul.  

#### Passage 2

>  “As a nation we have no literature,” the literary  
> (line 45) critic Belinsky cries in despair in part one of Tom  
> Stoppard’s play The Coast of Utopia, lamenting the  
> influence of European writers on Russian writers, and  
> stressing the importance of creating a national story of  
> their own.  
>  (line 50) With storytelling comes a sense of identity. But  
> national literatures evolve in stages, and the need for a  
> literature of one’s own changes according to the  
> political situation of the nation in question. A new  
> nation, or a nation struggling to declare its  
> (line 55) independence, will be driven to create something that  
> is theirs, a literature that tells their national story. But  
> the flux of modern history makes this a more or less  
> impossible task.   
>  “The universal idea speaks through humanity itself,  
> (line 60) and differently through each nation in each stage of its  
> history,” Belinsky says, later in the same speech. The  
> need for a national literature changes according to the  
> moment the nation is experiencing, and Stoppard  
> catches this exactly—on one hand the ardent yearning   
> (line 65) for one, and on the other, the contingency of the  
> literature on the historical moment.  
>  At the recent Festival America in Paris, the question  
> of a writer’s nationality and ethnic identity preoccupied  
> most of the discussions. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,  
> (line 70) the Nigerian-born author of Half of a Yellow Sun,  
> argued for Nigerian literature to be taught in Nigerian  
> schools. “It’s a paradox,” she said. “People can be  
> considered educated while knowing nothing about our  
> history. \[They\] read English books, not Nigerian  
> (line 75) books! What this means is we really don’t have a sense  
> of our own history.” Such history, she said, could not  
> be written by outsiders. “The stories of Africa should  
> be written by Africans,” she declared.

#### Do Goats Look to Us for Help?

>   Scientists have long known that some animals that have  
> been bred to interact with humans, such as dogs and horses,  
> will make eye contact to communicate with their human  
> companions. A recent study by scientists at Queen Mary  
> University of London examined whether goats, animals that  
> have been bred as livestock rather than as companions or  
> working animals, could also utilize eye contact.  
> In the study, goats were habituated to friendly   
> interactions with (1) **humans, they were trained** to open a  
> transparent plastic box to retrieve food. The goats were then  
> divided into two groups and placed one at a time in a pen  
> with an (2) **experimenter who** put food into an unopenable  
> box, leaving the food visible but (3) **impassable.** For goats  
> in the first group, the experimenter then continued to look  
> at the food box, his face fully visible to the goats. For goats  
> in the second group, the experimenter turned his back on  
> the food box, a position that prevented the goats from  
> seeing his face.
